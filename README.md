# AMOLED Clock Launcher
Simple Android clock app which can be set as a default launcher.

## Goal
I wanted to recycle my old Android phone which has AMOLED display.

Getting inspiration from Ambient Display, I also wanted to make an app as a launcher app so that it shows automatically when the phone starts.

## Caution
It holds legacy (compared to Lollipop) WakeLock APIs.

As this app is intended to be a clock, a display (or backlit) is always turned on until a phone shuts down because of low power level.

It takes advantage of AMOLED display, but you may also install this app on any other devices.
